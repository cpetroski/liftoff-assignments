## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project is a mood tracker. I want to enable people to track their moods/how they're feeling so that they can share the data with the professionals with whom they work. I want to help people figure out why they feel the way they do. I want to help them find triggers for both ups and downs so they can harness that knowlege and make it work for them. Most of the mood trackers on the market are behind a paywall or include ads, so it would be amazing to partner with an organization to make the tool free for users.
